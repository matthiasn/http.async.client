http.async.client - Asynchronous HTTP Client for Clojure
========================================================

**FORKED** to make [adamwynne/twitter-api](https://github.com/adamwynne/twitter-api) work with **Clojure 1.9.0-alpha14. Ideally, the twitter-api should be updated to use dependencies that will work with Clojure 1.9.

## *tl;dr*
Declare dependency:

``` clojure
(defproject your-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Your project description"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.6.0"]
                 [http.async.client "0.5.3"]])
```

Require:

``` clojure
(ns sample (:require [http.async.client :as http]))
```

GET resource:

``` clojure
(with-open [client (http/create-client)]
  (let [response (http/GET client "http://cch1.github.com/http.async.client/")]
    (-> response
      http/await
      http/string)))
```

[*http.async.client*](http://github.com/cch1/http.async.client) is
based on [Asynchronous Http Client for Java](http://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client), whose
discussion forum is available [here](http://groups.google.com/group/httpasyncclient).

It runs with Clojure 1.4.0, 1.5.1 and 1.6.0.  Development is against Clojure 1.6.0.
